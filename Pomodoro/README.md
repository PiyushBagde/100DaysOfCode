**Pomodoro**
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into focused intervals separated by short breaks.

- 25-Minute Intervals: Work in focused intervals of 25 minutes.
- Short Breaks: Take short breaks of 5 minutes after each interval.
- Long Break: Take a longer break of 15-30 minutes after completing four cycles.
