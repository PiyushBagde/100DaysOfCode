## **Automate Data Entry with Python**
It automates data entry using web scraping and form submission.

### The Script's Functionality:

1. **Data Scraping** :
- It retrieves data (addresses, prices, and links) from a sample Zillow-like website.
- This data represents sample property listings.

2. **Form Submission** :
- The script opens a Google Form (replace the URL with your target form if applicable).
- It iterates through the scraped data, filling out form fields (address, price, link) for each property.
- A short pause is included between submissions to avoid overwhelming the form.
