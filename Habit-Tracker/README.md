## **HABIT Tracker: let's make it thinng of everyday! ðŸ“…**

 It leverages the [Pixela API](https://pixe.la/), a fun and visual way to track your progress. By combining the power of habit tracking with Pixela's engaging interface, you'll stay motivated and accountable on your path to self-improvement.

### How It Works:
- Account Creation: You'll need to create a free Pixela account to connect your habit data.
- Habit Registration: You'll use the Python script to register new habits within Pixela, specifying their names and any additional details you'd like to track.

### https Requests method:
- **GET** (not explicitly used): While not directly used in this code, GET could be employed to retrieve information about existing graphs or user data.
- **POST**: Creates new resources - used for creating a user in Pixela and registering a new graph with specific configurations.
- **PUT**: Updates existing resources - used to modify a graph's unit (e.g., changing from "Km" to "hours").
- **DELETE**: Removes resources - used to delete a specific pixel entry for a particular date on a graph.
