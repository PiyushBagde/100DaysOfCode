## **Automate Your Internet Speed Monitoring 🤏and Complaint Tweets**

It automates checking your internet speed and raising complaints on Twitter if it falls below your desired levels.

### Here's how it works:

- Speed Test: The script uses Selenium to navigate to a speed test website and retrieves your download and upload speeds.
- Complaint Check: It compares your speeds with your desired minimums.
- Tweet the Provider: drafts a complaint tweet tagging your internet provider.
